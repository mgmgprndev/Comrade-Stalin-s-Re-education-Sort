# Comrade-Stalin-s-Re-education-Sort
This is a conceptually simple sorting algorithm. In each step, it separates a sorted subsequence and recursively sorts the remaining elements. Its best-case performance is O(n), but its worst-case is O(nÂ²).

# Result in Our Test (Benchmarking)
We run this sorting algorithm on a completely random array of numbers (size: 100000), and repeat 1000 times.
RESULT:
```
Average: 1.4060817515850068 seconds
Minimum: 1.229198932647705 seconds
Maximum: 2.0363264083862305 seconds
